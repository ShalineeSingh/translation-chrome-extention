# Translation Extension

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.12.

This project was created as I wanted to learn a new language and taking out time specifically for that was getting more difficult. 

## Steps to use this project

1. Decide the language that you want to learn. (Currently around 500 words are added in Tamil and French)
2. Add the word you know with the translated text in the language you want to learn in assets/data.json
3. Build the project and run
4. Unpack the chrome extension and load the `dist` folder.

Now every time you open a new tab, you will see a random word from the list that you added.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
